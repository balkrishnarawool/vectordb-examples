# Vector DB Examples
Some examples of using Vector DB:
1. [A text search with PG Vector](pgvector-text-search/README.md)  
Embed and store texts in vector database (postgres with pg-vector) and then search using similarity search. 
2. [An image search with Weaviate](weaviate-image-search/README.md)  
Embed and store images in vector database (weaviate) and then search using similarity search.


## TODO
1. Probably create simple examples of gray-scale colours and RGB colours.
2. Build image search with pg-vector
